## Roadmap

- make it work for more than one insert at the time
- add more colours compatible with dark themes
- add colours for light themes
- measure and address performance issues for huge sql files
- NICE TO HAVE: have legend in sidenav if you have a long INSERT and forget which field is for what
- EXPERIMENT: if it would work better with the lines of code that are visible instead of the entire file
